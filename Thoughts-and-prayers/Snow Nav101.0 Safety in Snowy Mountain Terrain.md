# Stay safe in snowy mountains — regardless of how you travel

*This guide is meant to equip the reader with a baseline knowledge for safe travel in mountainous winter terrain. It supplements — but does not replace the professional hands-on training offered by the [AIARE content and courses](https://avtraining.org/recprogram/), and practice with planning and Search and Rescue (SAR) tools. It is not affiliated with any formal educational provider. Your writer holds a [American Avalanche Institute AIARE Level II certification](https://www.americanavalancheinstitute.com/course/avalanche-level-2/). He has accumulated two decades of snow condition study by adventuring through the western mountains in nearly all known means and conditions.*

Hey — Calebhere (commonly pronounced Cawleeb 😏).
> This guide shoots to expand beyond the usual 2 line snow safety dialogue of: "Yes, bring a beacon, shovel, and probe. No, don't go on or under slopes ≥ 30°." <a href="#full-intro">Read more</a>

## Critical snow safety tools
- Beacon, shovel, and probe
- Smartphone or device with a [gradient color-shaded mapping app](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=40.56771,-111.64002&z=15&b=mbt&a=sg) and an inclinometer app

## Recommended extras
- First-aid kit
- Extra insulating layers and emergency shelter
- Navigation backup (paper map & compass, extra power)



## Tutorial: Using a slope-angle shader / inclinometer

1. Open your gradient-shaded map (CalTopo, Gaia, etc.) and enable slope shading. 
*Insert a how-to GIF here*
2. Use an inclinometer app or the map's tools to measure the slope angle on your planned route.
3. Treat slopes ≥ 30° as high-risk avalanche terrain and avoid travel there unless you have formal avalanche training and a conservative group decision process.
